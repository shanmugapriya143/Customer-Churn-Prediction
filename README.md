# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
Customer churn is when a customer stops using a company's service. Predicting churn helps businesses take proactive measures to retain valuable customers. This project aims to predict whether a customer will discontinue a service using machine learning techniques and provide a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

---

## Problem Statement
High customer churn can significantly impact revenue. By analyzing customer behavior and service usage patterns, this project identifies customers who are likely to churn, allowing companies to implement retention strategies.

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Machine Learning**: Python, Scikit-learn, LightGBM  
- **Backend**: Flask  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
